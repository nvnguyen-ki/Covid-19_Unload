## Covid-19 Application
Simple full stack application to get a better understanding of deploying a full stack application.
Collected covid-19 data from [rapid api](https://rapidapi.com/axisbits-axisbits-default/api/covid-19-statistics?endpoint=apiendpoint_191c58c7-a995-4024-a5ee-41043d79e542) and [covidtracking](https://covidtracking.com/data).


Since heroku is hosting back-end server: if the server is not in use within a 30 minute time span, it will go to sleep. 
Once you go on the site, you'll have to wait a bit and reload for the server to wake up which will than load the covid-19 statistics.
